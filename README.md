# Questioner-react
Questioner is an application that crowd-sources questions for meetups. It allows meetup organizers to prioritize the questions to be answered. And users of this platform can upvote or downvote a question. The questions however, are ranked according to their votes. This application is the UI of the Questioner repository and will be built with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
